Requirements:
python3

-> Assuming a linux environment, library requirements can be completed by running the command "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" with assignment folder as current working directory.

HOW TO RUN:
->Open jupyter notebook (you may do that by entering 'jupyter notebook' on your terminal), and open the following files using it.
1) The 'code' folder has a file, UnderstandingDataset.ipynb. This is the code I used for first section of the assignment.
2) The 'code' folder has a file, RecoModelling.ipynb. This file contains code for all the questions of Recomendation Modelling section.
